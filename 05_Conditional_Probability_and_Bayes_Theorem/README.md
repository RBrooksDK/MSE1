--------------------------

Building on our introduction to probability, this session delves deeper into the subject by exploring the concepts of dependent and independent events. We will discuss how the occurrence of one event can affect the probability of another. Conditional probability will be introduced, highlighting how probabilities change when additional information is known. We will also cover the probability of intersections between events, helping to understand overlapping occurrences. Contingency tables will be used to organize data and calculate probabilities effectively, and we will conclude with Bayes' theorem, a powerful tool for updating probabilities based on new evidence.

#### Key Concepts:
- Dependent and independent events
- Conditional probability
- The probability for the intersection between events
- Contingency tables
- Bayes' theorem
