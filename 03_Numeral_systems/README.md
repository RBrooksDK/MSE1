Numeral systems are methods for expressing numbers using a consistent set of symbols. The four most commonly used numeral systems in computing and mathematics are decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.

1. **Decimal (Base 10):**
   - The decimal system is the most familiar, used in everyday counting and calculations. It is a base-10 system, meaning it uses ten digits: 0 through 9. Each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10.

2. **Binary (Base 2):**
   - The binary system is fundamental in computing and digital electronics. It is a base-2 system, meaning it uses only two digits: 0 and 1. Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2.

3. **Octal (Base 8):**
   - The octal system is a base-8 system, using eight digits: 0 through 7. Each position in an octal number represents a power of 8.

4. **Hexadecimal (Base 16):**
   - The hexadecimal system is widely used in computing to represent binary data in a more human-readable form. It is a base-16 system, using sixteen symbols: 0-9 and A-F, where A represents 10, B represents 11, and so on up to F, which represents 15. Each position in a hexadecimal number represents a power of 16.

These numeral systems are used to simplify data representation, processing, and conversion.
