### Session 

In this session, we delve into the basics of combinatorics and probability theory. We will explore fundamental principles like the multiplication rule, which is essential for understanding how to count outcomes in complex situations. The session will also cover combinations and permutations, both with and without replacement, providing a comprehensive understanding of how to calculate different arrangements and selections. Additionally, we will introduce key concepts in probability theory, such as experiments and sample spaces, the probability of events, and the probability of complements, unions, and differences between events.

#### Key Concepts:
- The multiplication rule
- Combinations and permutations (with and without replacement)
- Experiments and sample spaces in probability theory
- The probability of an event
- The probability of the complement, union, and difference between events
