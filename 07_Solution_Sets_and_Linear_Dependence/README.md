--------------------------

In this session, we will continue our exploration of linear algebra, focusing on the solution sets of linear systems. We will delve into the parametric vector form, which provides a comprehensive way to describe all solutions to a system of linear equations. The concepts of linear independence and dependence will be introduced, helping students understand the conditions under which a set of vectors forms a basis for a vector space. Additionally, this session will introduce Python programming, specifically how to work with matrices using libraries like NumPy and SymPy, as well as handling data with pandas DataFrames.

#### Key Concepts:
- Solution Set of a Linear System
- Parametric Vector Form
- Linear Independence and Dependence
- Introduction to Python for Linear Algebra
- Working with Matrices in Python using NumPy
- Symbolic Computation with SymPy
- Handling Data with Pandas DataFrames
