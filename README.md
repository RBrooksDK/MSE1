This repository contains resources for the [Mathematics for Software Engineering](https://en.via.dk/tmh-courses/mathematics-for-software-engineering?education=ict) course at VIA University College, Horsens, Denmark.

The course consists of 12 scheduled lectures, each with a duration of 2 lessons (90 minutes in total), as well as 12 scheduled recitations, each with a duration of 4 lessons (180 minutes). The students learn new theory in the lectures and use this to solve problems and exercises in the recitations. No new theory is taught at recitations.

## Literature & Resources

All literature will be made available to the student.

## Software

Before session 06, make sure you install a working version of Jupyter Notebook and Python version 3.7 or higher. The easiest way to install Python and Jupyter is using [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). You can choose whichever framework you want to work in as long as it can handle Jupyter Notebooks. Installing VS Code with a Jupyter Notebook extension seems to be a popular choice..

## Hand-ins

All hand-ins will be made during the recitations and must be handed in at the end of recitation.
