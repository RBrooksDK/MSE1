--------------------------

In this session, we focus on two fundamental concepts in programming: functions and loops. We'll begin by analysing loops, including how they operate and their role in programming, with a particular focus on understanding the performance implications of different types of loops. We will also explore functions in depth, examining their structure, usage, and importance in writing efficient and reusable code. Special attention will be given to hash functions, which are critical in many areas of computer science, including data retrieval and security. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid understanding of how loops and functions work, how to analyse their performance, and how to use them effectively in your code.

#### Key Concepts:
- Pseudocode
- Loop Analysis
- Types of Loops (e.g., for loops, while loops)
- Performance Implications of Loops
- Functions in Programming (also called methods in Java)
- Structure and Usage of Functions
