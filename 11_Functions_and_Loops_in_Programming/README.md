--------------------------

In this session, we focus on two fundamental concepts in programming: functions and loops. We'll begin by analyzing loops, including how they operate and their role in programming, with a particular focus on understanding the performance implications of different types of loops. We will also explore functions in depth, examining their structure, usage, and importance in writing efficient and reusable code. Special attention will be given to hash functions, which are critical in many areas of computer science, including data retrieval and security. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid understanding of how loops and functions work, how to analyze their performance, and how to implement hash functions effectively.

#### Key Concepts:
- Loop Analysis
- Types of Loops (e.g., for loops, while loops)
- Performance Implications of Loops
- Functions in Programming
- Structure and Usage of Functions
- Introduction to Hash Functions
- Applications of Hash Functions
