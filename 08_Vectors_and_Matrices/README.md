--------------------------

Today, we will explore the fundamental concepts that form the backbone of linear algebra. We'll start with **vectors**, understanding how these entities with magnitude and direction are essential for representing data and physical quantities in multiple dimensions.

Next, we'll delve into **vector equations** to see how relationships between vectors are expressed and solved. This will naturally lead us to **matrix equations**, where we'll discover powerful methods for handling multiple equations and unknowns simultaneously.

We'll examine the **solution set of a linear system**, exploring scenarios with unique solutions, infinitely many solutions, or no solution at all. By connecting algebraic methods to geometric interpretations, we'll visualize how lines and planes intersect in space.

To better understand complex solution sets, we'll introduce the **parametric vector form**, which uses parameters to describe all possible solutions of a system clearly. Finally, we'll tackle **linear independence and dependence**, learning how these concepts determine the minimal set of vectors needed to span a space.

By the end of the session, we'll have built a strong foundation in these core concepts, preparing us for more advanced topics in linear algebra.
