--------------------------

In this session, we will explore some of the most fundamental concepts in linear algebra, particularly focusing on eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and the process of diagonalization. These concepts are essential for understanding the behavior of linear transformations and play a crucial role in various applications, from solving systems of differential equations to analyzing stability in dynamic systems. We will begin by defining eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and then move on to discuss the eigenspace associated with an eigenvalue. The session will also cover the characteristic equation, a key tool for finding eigenvalues. Finally, we will examine triangular matrices and the process of diagonalization, which simplifies many problems in linear algebra.

#### Key Concepts:
- Eigenvalues
- Eigenvectors
- Eigenspace
- The Characteristic Equation
- Triangular Matrices
