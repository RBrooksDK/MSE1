--------------------------

In this session, we delve into the foundational concepts of algorithms and their analysis. We will begin by exploring what algorithms are and why they are central to computer science and mathematics. The session will introduce asymptotic notation, which is crucial for describing the efficiency of algorithms. We will examine time complexity, focusing on how to analyze the performance of algorithms as the input size grows. Specific programming constructs, such as for loops, nested for loops, and if-statements, will be discussed in the context of their impact on time complexity. Additionally, we will cover growth functions to understand how different algorithms scale and how to perform asymptotic analysis using limits.

#### Key Concepts:
- Introduction to Algorithms
- Asymptotic Notation
- Time Complexity
- Code analysis of for loops, nested loops, IF-statements
