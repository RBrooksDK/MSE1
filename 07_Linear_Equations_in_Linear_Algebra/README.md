# 7. Linear Equations in Linear Algebra

**Session Preparation:**

Brooks: [Chapter 7](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P9eidJb5qtlZgvHCtqu4uuPa5FFU0Zpn/view?usp=sharing). You should begin reading before class as it will aid your understanding as the topics get more complex.

Note: Please make sure you have a working version of Python 3.7 (or higher) and Jupyter Notebook installed **before** this session. I recommend using VS code with the Jupyter Notebook plugin.

--------------------------

This session introduces the fundamental concepts of linear algebra, focusing on systems of linear equations and their solutions. We will learn how to represent these systems using coefficient matrices and augmented matrices, and how to manipulate them using elementary row operations. We will explore the concepts of echelon forms, pivot positions, and the row reduction algorithm, which are essential for solving linear systems. By the end of this session, students should be able to solve linear systems using row reduction and understand the geometric interpretation of span in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$.

#### Key Concepts:
- Coefficient Matrix and Augmented Matrix
- Elementary Row Operations: Replacement, Interchange, Scaling
- Echelon Form and Reduced Echelon Form
- Pivot Positions and Pivot Columns
- Basic Variables and Free Variables
- Introduction to Python for Linear Algebra
- Working with Matrices in Python using NumPy
- Symbolic Computation with SymPy
- Handling Data with Pandas DataFrames
