### Exercise 1: Boolean Algebra Recap

Consider the Boolean function $F(x, y, z)=x y+y(z+x)$. 

a. State the truth table for this function. If the table is constructed correctly, the last column will contain $F$ and will have 8 rows. Reading the rows from the botton up will give you a binary value. Convert this value to decimal and state this as your result.
